"""Centralized state-availability rules for executeCommand buttons.

Each dict maps a button value (the string sent to the API) to the list of
``applianceState`` values in which that command is accepted by the cloud.
When a ``None`` is assigned, no restriction is imposed — the button is always
available as long as the appliance is connected.

These constants are imported by catalog files via ``available_when_states=`` and
consumed by :class:`~custom_components.electrolux.button.ElectroluxButton`.
Keeping them here means the rules for every appliance type live in one place and
are easy to extend when new API samples become available.

They are a fallback. An appliance that publishes ``applianceState`` triggers
describes its own state machine, and :func:`execute_states_from_capabilities`
reads that instead, so a model whose rules differ from its type's table gets the
right buttons without a new constant.
